			<p>
				<span>There came a common beggar, wont to ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alms through the town of Ithaca, well known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For greediness of stomach, gluttonous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a wine-bibber, but of little strength</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And courage, though he seemed of powerful mould.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arnaeus was the name which at his birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mother gave him, but the young men called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fellow Irus, for it was his wont</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To go on errands, as a messenger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he was ordered. Coming now, he thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drive Ulysses out of his own house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And railed at him, and said in winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hence with thee! leave the porch, old man, at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest thou be taken by the foot and dragged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away from it. Dost thou not see how all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around us nod, to bid me drag thee out?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am ashamed to do it. Rise and go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else haply we may have a strife of blows.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wretch! there is nothing that I do or say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To harm thee aught. I do not envy thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What others give thee, though the dole be large;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ample is this threshold for us both.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shouldst thou envy others, for thou seemst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A straggler like myself. The gods bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wealth where they list. But do not challenge me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blows, lest, aged as I am, thou rouse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My anger, and I make thy breast and lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hideous with blood. Tomorrow then will be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A quiet day for me, since thou, I trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the time to come, wilt never more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enter the palace of Laertes’ son.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beggar Irus angrily rejoined:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye gods! this glutton prattles volubly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like an old woman at the chimney-side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet could I do him mischief, smiting him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On both his sides, and dashing from his cheeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The teeth to earth, as men are wont to deal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With swine that eat the wheat. Now gird thyself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let these men see us fighting. How canst thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think to contend with one so young as I?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus fiercely did they wrangle as they stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the polished threshold and before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lofty gates. The stout Antinoüs heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, laughing heartily, bespake the rest:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Here, friends, is what we never yet have had.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold the pleasant pastime which the gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Provide for us. These men⁠—the stranger here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Irus⁠—quarrel, and will come to blows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us stand by and bring the combat on.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake. All rose with laughter and came round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ragged beggars, while Eupeithes’ son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Antinoüs, in these words harangued the rest:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye noble suitors, hear me. At the fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Already lie the paunches of two goats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Preparing for our evening meal, and both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are filled with fat and blood. Whoever shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself the better man in this affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And conquers, he shall take the one of these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He chooses, and shall ever afterward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feast at our table, and no man but he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall ever come among us asking alms.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ended. All approved his words, and thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, craftily dissembling, said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O friends, it is not well that one so old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I, and broken by calamity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should fight a younger man; but hunger bids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I may be o’ercome by blows. But now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swear all a solemn oath, that none of you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To favor Irus, wickedly will raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mighty hand to smite me, and so aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My adversary to my overthrow.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; the suitor-train, assenting, took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The oath, and when they all were duly sworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The highborn prince Telemachus began:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O stranger, if thy manly heart be moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drive him hence, fear no one else of all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Achaians. Whosoever strikes at thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has many to contend with. I am here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The host. Antinoüs and Eurymachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wise men and kings, agree with me in this.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and all approved. Ulysses drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And girt his tatters round his waist and showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His large and shapely thighs. Unclothed appeared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His full broad shoulders, and his manly breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sinewy arms. Minerva stood by him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a mighty breadth of limb endued</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shepherd of the people. Earnestly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors gazed, and wondered at the sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each one, turning to his neighbor, said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Irus, poor Irus, on himself has drawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An evil fate, for what a sinewy thigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His adversary shows beneath his rags!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So talked they, while the heart of Irus sank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within him; yet the attendants girding him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forcibly drew him forward, sore afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The muscles quivering over every limb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then Antinoüs spake, and chid him thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, boaster, thou deservest not to live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, nor to have been born, if thou dost fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And quake at meeting one so old as he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So broken with the hardships he has borne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now I tell thee what will yet be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should he approve himself the better man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And conquer. I will have thee sent on board</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A galley to Epirus, and its king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foe of all men living, Echetus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he will pare away thy nose and ears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the sharp steel, and, wrenching out the parts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of shame, will cast them to be torn by dogs.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and Irus shook through all his frame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With greater terror, yet they dragged him on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the midst. Both champions lifted up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their arms. The godlike, much-enduring man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, pondered whether so to strike</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His adversary that the breath of life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might leave him as he fell, or only smite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stretch him on the earth. As thus he mused,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lighter blow seemed wisest, lest the Greeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should know who dealt it. When the hands of both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were thus uplifted, Irus gave a blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his right shoulder, while Ulysses smote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Irus beneath the ear, and broke the bone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within, and brought the red blood from his mouth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fell amid the dust, and shrieked and gnashed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His teeth, and beat with jerking feet the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitor-train threw up their hands and laughed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till breathless, while Ulysses seized his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drew him o’er the threshold to the court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the porch doors, and there, beside the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set him to lean against it, gave a staff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into his hands, and said in winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sit there, and scare away the dogs and swine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But think not, wretched creature, to bear rule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the stranger and the beggar tribe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or worse than this may happen to thee yet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and o’er his shoulders threw the scrip</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That yawned with chinks, and by a twisted thong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was fastened; then he turned to take his seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the threshold, while the suitor-train</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went back into the palace with gay shouts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of laughter, and bespake him blandly thus:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Stranger, may Jove and all the other gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant thee what thou desirest, and whate’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is pleasant to thee! Thou hast put an end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this importunate beggar’s rounds among</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people. We shall send him off at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Epirus, and to Echetus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its king, the foe of every living man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So talked the suitors, and the omen made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses glad. Meantime Antinoüs placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty paunch before the victor, filled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With blood and fat, and from the canister</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amphinomus brought forth two loaves, and raised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A golden cup and drank to him, and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hail, guest and father! happy be thy days</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforth, though dark with many sorrows now!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Amphinomus, thou seemest most discreet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And such thy father is, of whom I hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A worshipful report, the good and rich</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dulichian Nisus. Thou, as I am told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art son to him, and thou art seemingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man of pertinent speech. I therefore say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thee, and bid thee hear and mark me well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No being whom earth nourishes to breathe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her air and move upon her face is more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sport of circumstance than man. For while</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gods give health, and he is strong of limb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He thinks no evil in the coming days</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will overtake him. When the blessed gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Visit him with afflictions, these he bears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impatiently and with a fretful mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is the mood of man, while yet he dwells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On earth; it changes as the All-Father gives</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sunshine or withholds it. I was once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deemed fortunate among my fellow-men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many things that were unjust I did;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in my strength and in my father’s power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And valor of my brothers, I had put</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My trust. Let no man, therefore, dare to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unjust in aught, but tranquilly enjoy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever good the gods vouchsafe to give.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet are these suitors guilty of foul wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wasting the substance and dishonoring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wife of one who will not, as I deem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remain long distant from his friends and home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But is already near. O, may some god</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remove thee from this danger to thy home!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor mayst thou meet him when he shall return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his own land. For when he comes once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath this roof, and finds the suitors here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not without bloodshed will their parting be.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake, and, pouring out a part, he drank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wine, and gave the goblet to the prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who crossed the hall, and sorrowfully shook</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His head, for now already did his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forebode the coming evil. Not by this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did he escape his death. Minerva laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A snare for him, that he might fall beneath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strong arm of Telemachus. He went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took the seat from which he lately rose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then blue-eyed Pallas moved Penelope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sage daughter of Icarius, to appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the suitors, that their base intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might be more fully seen, and she might win</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More honor from her husband and her son.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore she forced a laugh, and thus began:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Eurynomè, I would at length appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though not till now, before the suitor-train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Detested as they are. I there would speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A word of timely warning to my son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And give him counsel not to trust himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too much among the suitors, who are fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In speech, but mean him foully in their hearts.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eurynomè, the household matron, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Assuredly, my child, thou speakest well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go now, and warn thy son, and keep back naught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First bathe, and, ere thou go, anoint thy cheeks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor show them stained with tears. It is not well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sorrow without end. For now thy son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is grown, and thou beholdest him at length</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thou didst pray the gods, when he was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he might yet become, a bearded man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then the sage Penelope rejoined:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Though anxious for my sake, persuade me not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eurynomè, to bathe, nor to anoint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My cheeks with oil. The gods inhabiting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Olympus took away their comeliness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in his roomy ships my husband sailed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But bid Antinoe come, and call with her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hippodameïa, that they both may stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside me in the hall. I will not go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone among the men, for very shame.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake, the aged dame went forth to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The message, and to bring the women back.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While blue-eyed Pallas had yet other cares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She brought a balmy sleep, and shed it o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The daughter of Icarius, as she lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reclined upon her couch, her limbs relaxed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In rest. The glorious goddess gave a dower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heavenly graces, that the Achaian chiefs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might look on her amazed. She lighted up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fair face with a beauty all divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as the queenly Cytherea wears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in the mazes of the dance she joins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Graces. Then she made her to the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of loftier stature and of statelier size,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fairer than the ivory newly carved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This having done, the gracious power withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While from the palace came the white-armed maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prattled as they came. The balmy sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forsook their mistress at the sound. She passed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her hands across her cheeks, and thus she spake:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Twas a sweet sleep that, in my wretchedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapped me just now. Would that, this very hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chaste Diana by so soft a death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might end me, that my days might be no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Consumed in sorrow for a husband lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of peerless worth, the noblest of the Greeks.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake, and from the royal bower went down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet not alone; two maidens went with her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when that most august of womankind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew near the suitors, at the door she stopped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that magnificent hall, and o’er her cheeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let fall the lustrous veil, while on each side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A modest maiden stood. The suitors all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt their knees tremble, and were sick with love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all desired her. Then the queen bespake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telemachus, her well-beloved son:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Telemachus, thy judgment is not firm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor dost thou think aright. While yet a boy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy thought was wiser. Now that thou art grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the verge of manhood, so that one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who comes from far and sees thy noble part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stature well may say thou art the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a most fortunate father, yet to think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And judge discreetly thou art not as then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what a deed is this which has been done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even here! Thou hast allowed a stranger guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be assaulted rudely. How is this?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If one who sits a guest beneath our roof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be outraged thus, be sure it brings to thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great shame and rank dishonor among men.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To this discreet Telemachus replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mother, I cannot take it ill that thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst be offended. But of many things</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have a clear discernment, and can weigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The good and bad. I was till now a child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet even now I cannot always see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wiser course. These men bewilder me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As, sitting side by side, they lay their plots</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against me, and I have no helper here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Irus and the stranger fought, the strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had no such issue as the suitors wished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stranger conquered. Would to Father Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Pallas and Apollo, that the crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of suitors here might sit with nodding heads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck down upon the spot, within these halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or in the courts, and all with powerless limbs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Irus sits beside the gate and nods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like one o’ercome with wine, nor can he stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his feet, nor go to where he dwells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If home he has, so feeble are his limbs.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So talked the twain awhile; then interposed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eurymachus, and thus bespake the queen:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sage daughter of Icarius! if all those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who in Iäsian Argos have their homes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should once behold thee, a still larger crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of suitors would tomorrow come and feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within thy halls, so much dost thou excel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mind and form and face all womankind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To this the sage Penelope replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Eurymachus, the immortals took away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such grace of form and face as once was mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What time the sons of Argos sailed for Troy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with them went Ulysses, my espoused.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should he return, and take again in charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My household, greater would my glory be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prized more highly. I am wretched now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such woes the gods have heaped upon my head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, when he left his native island, grasped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My right hand at the wrist, and said to me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Think not, dear wife, that all the well-armed Greeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will come back safe from Troy. The Trojan men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say, are brave in war, expert to cast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spear and wing the arrow, skilled to rein</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rapid steeds by which the bloody strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battlefields is hurried to its close;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore whether God will bring me back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or I shall fall in Troy, I cannot know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take charge of all things here. I leave with thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father and my mother in these halls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be kind to them as now, nay, more than now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I shall not be here. When thou shalt see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My son a bearded man, take to thyself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A husband, whom thou wilt, and leave thy house.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such were his words, and they have been fulfilled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The night will come in which I must endure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This hateful marriage, wretched that I am,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the will of Jupiter forbids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All consolation, and this bitter thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weighs evermore upon my heart and soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The custom was not thus in other times;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When suitors wooed a noble wife, the child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some rich house, contending for her smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They came with beeves and fatling sheep to feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damsel’s friends, and gave munificent gifts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wasted not the wealth that was not theirs.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake, Ulysses was rejoiced to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thus she sought to draw from each a gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With fair and artful words. Yet were his thoughts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Intent on other plans. Eupeithes’ son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Antinoüs, thus made answer to the queen:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sage daughter of Icarius, only deign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take the gifts which any of the Greeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will bring⁠—nor is it gracious to reject</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A present⁠—yet be sure we go not hence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To our estates nor elsewhere, till thou make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bridegroom of the best Achaian here.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake Antinoüs. All approved his words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each sent forth a herald for his gift.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The herald of Antinoüs brought to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A robe of many colors, beautiful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ample, with twelve golden clasps, which each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had its well-fitted eye. Eurymachus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Received a golden necklace, richly wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set with amber beads, that glowed as if</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sunshine. To Eurydamas there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pair of earrings, each a triple gem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daintily fashioned and of exquisite grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two servants bore them. From Pisander’s house⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son of the Prince Polyctor⁠—there was brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A collar of rare beauty. Thus did each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bestow a different yet becoming gift.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then that most august of women went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the upper chambers with her maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who bore the sumptuous presents, while below</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors turned them to the dance and song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amused till evening came. Its darkness stole</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over their pastime. Then they brought and placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three hearths to light the palace, heaping them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With wood, well dried and hard and newly cleft.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With this they mingled flaming brands. The maids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the great sufferer, Ulysses, fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire by turns. To them the hero spake:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye maidens of a sovereign absent long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Withdraw to where your highborn mistress sits;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There turn the spindle, seeking to amuse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her lonely hours; there comb with your own hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fleece, and I will see that these have light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even though they linger till the Morn is here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her bright car, they cannot overcome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My patience. I am practised to endure.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake he, and the maidens, as they heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast at each other meaning looks, and laughed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one Melantho, of the rosy cheeks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Railed at him impudently. She was born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Dolius, but Penelope had reared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damsel as a daughter of her own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And given her, for her pleasure, many things;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet for the sorrows of Penelope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Melantho little cared. Eurymachus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made the girl his paramour. She spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chid Ulysses with unmannerly words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Outlandish wretch! thou must be one whose brain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is turned, since thou wilt neither go to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within a smithy, nor in any place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of public shelter, but wilt stay and prate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among this company with no restraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or reverence. Either wine has stolen away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy senses, or thy natural mood, perchance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prompts thee to chatter idly. Art thou proud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of conquering Irus, that poor vagabond?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beware lest someone of robuster arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than Irus seize and thrust thee out of doors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a bruised head and face begrimed with blood.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sage Ulysses frowned on her and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Impudent one, Telemachus shall hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From me the saucy words which thou hast said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he will come and hew thee limb from limb.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; the damsels, frightened at his words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled through the hall, and shook in every limb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With terror, lest his threat should be fulfilled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He meantime stood beside the kindled hearths</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fed the flames, and, looking on the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of suitors, brooded in his secret heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er plans that would not fail to be fulfilled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Pallas suffered not the suitors yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cease from railing speeches, all the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wound the spirit of Laertes’ son.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to scoff at him, and thus he spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wake the ready laughter of the rest:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I speak the thought that comes into my mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led by some god, no doubt, this man has come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the palace; for the light we have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of torches seems to issue from the crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his bald pate, a head without a hair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said Eurymachus, and then bespake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulysses, the destroyer of walled towns:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Stranger, if I accept thee, wilt thou serve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the distant parts of my estate?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There shalt thou have fair wages, and shalt bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stones in heaps together, and shalt plant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tall trees, and I will feed thee through the year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And give thee clothes, and sandals for thy feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou art used, no doubt, to idle ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never dost thou work with willing hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bat dost prefer to roam the town and beg,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Purveying for thy gluttonous appetite.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Eurymachus, if we were matched in work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against each other in the time of spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When days are long, and both were mowing grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I had a curved scythe in hand and thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another, that we might keep up the strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till nightfall, fasting, mid the abundant grass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if there were a yoke of steers to drive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sturdiest of their kind, sleek, large, well fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of equal age, and equal strength to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The labor, and both strong, and if the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were of four acres, with a soil through which</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The plough could cleave its way⁠—then shouldst thou see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How evenly my furrow would be turned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or should the son of Saturn send today</span>
				<br/>
				<span>War from abroad, and I had but a shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two spears, and, fitted to my brows, a helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of brass, thou wouldst behold me pressing on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the foremost warriors, and would see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No cause to rail at my keen appetite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But arrogantly thou dost bear thyself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pitilessly; thou in thine own eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art great and mighty, since thou dost consort</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With few, and those are not the best of men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet should Ulysses come to his own land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These gates that seem so wide would suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Become too narrow for thee in thy flight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake. Eurymachus grew yet more wroth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And frowned on him, and said in winged words:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wretch! I shall do thee mischief. Thou art bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And babblest unabashed among us all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wine, perhaps, is in thy foolish head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or thou art always thus, and ever prone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prattle impudently. Art thou proud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of conquering Irus, that poor vagabond?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus having said, he brandished in the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A footstool; but Ulysses, to escape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The anger of Eurymachus, sat down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the knees of the Dulichian prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amphinomus. The footstool flew, and struck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the right arm the cupbearer. Down fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beaker ringing; he who bore it lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretched in the dust. Then in those shadowy halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The suitors rose in tumult. One of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked at another by his side, and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Would that this vagabond had met his death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere he came hither. This confusion, then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had never been. ’Tis for a beggar’s sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We wrangle, and the feast will henceforth give</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No pleasure; we shall go from bad to worse.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rose in majesty Telemachus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said: “Ye are not in your senses sure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unhappy men, who cannot eat and drink</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In peace. Some deity, no doubt, has moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your minds to frenzy. Now, when each of you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has feasted well, let each withdraw to sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just when he will. I drive no man away.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake; the suitors heard, and bit their lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wondered at Telemachus, who spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So resolutely. Then Amphinomus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The son of Nisus Aretiades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood forth, harangued the suitor-crowd, and said:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O friends! let no one here with carping words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek to deny what is so justly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor yet molest the stranger, nor do harm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To any of the servants in the halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the great chief Ulysses. Now let him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who brings the guests their wine begin and fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cups, that, pouring to the gods their part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We may withdraw to sleep. The stranger here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave me within the palace, and in charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him to whom he came, Telemachus.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ended. All were pleased, and Mutlus then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hero and herald from Dulichium’s coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And follower of the prince Amphinomus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mingled a jar of wine, and went to each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dispensing it. They to the blessed gods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poured first a part, and then they drank themselves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The generous juice. And when the wine was poured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they had drunk what each desired, they went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Homeward to slumber, each in his abode.</span>
